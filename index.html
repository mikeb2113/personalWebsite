                <p>My name is Michael Bermudez. My coding journey began in my senior year of high school with an AP computer science course. While the class opened my eyes to the possibilities in technology, my real growth started as I ventured beyond the classroom. From building my first basic website the following summer, I've progressed to developing database-driven projects. This hands-on experience has been instrumental in refining my skills and fueling my passion for technology.</p>

                <p>When I'm not coding, I'm an avid gamer and a dedicated reader. These hobbies not only bring joy to my life but also enhance my professional skills, like the strategic thinking honed through gaming. I love diving into complex coding challenges, and I'm always eager to explore new technologies and collaborate on innovative projects.</p>

    <p>Hello Reader! Before we get started, how about some music? The player above will share some nostalgic music from one of my favorite childhood video games. The music will change based on the time of day it is played at, and over time nature sounds play over the music to further immerse you in the music.</p>

                    <p>This was one of the earlier projects that I completed during my time in college. It required students to parse data given to us by our instructor from excel and csv files to create an application that can display a list of instructors that the use can interact with. You could assign teachers courses, unassign courses and all of this would be guided by an intuitive GUI designed to let the user know what the best courses to assign are. These choices would be guided by what course the instructor already had experience teaching. Any change would be saved in a serialized file for data persistance.</p>

                    <p>I learned a lot in this project, but what I'm most proud of was that I created my own data sets in Python in order to stress test my application and saw that

                    </span> 
                    What made this application so fast was that I used a hashset to couple courses together by section, and I also used a hashset to store the instructors to quickly search them by ID.</p>

                    <p>However, <span class="bold-pseudo-container large-text">

I had also pulled an all-nighter, not out of necessity but because there were additional features that I wanted to add so that it would be entirely intuitive to use and feel better for the user. However, tired as I was, without noticing I had accidentally saved over my updated code with an old version and wound up losing my progress... If nothing else it was a lesson learned, and a mistake I don't see myself making any time soon.</p>

            <p>The core of the project is a robust database system that manages user accounts, including secure login and registration processes.

                 This empowers users to craft entirely unique Pokémon fusions, enhancing their engagement and creativity. The flexibility extends to visual customization, with several different sprites available for many Pokémon fusions, ensuring that every user's experience is distinct and filled with endless possibilities.

            <p>As a testament to my skills in database management, backend development with Flask, and frontend user experience design, the Pokémon Infinite Fusions Team Builder represents the perfect blend of my technical prowess and creative vision, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in interactive web applications.</p>

                <p>Where this app shines is it's use of design patterns for flexibility and easily scaleable code. It makes use of the strategy design pattern to allow users to schedule notifciations with differing behaviors, aswell as the template pattern so users may quickly create different notifications which will share similar text or notification behaviors. This application also employs the decorator pattern, so that if a notification is for a task the user must complete, they may choose to make the notification trigger at closer intervals at the allotted time to ensure that you stay on task. This app is designed to work even in the most niche cases. You may also set notifications for distant dates and intervals. For example, if you want to be notified a week before an end of year meeting every year, you may log into the app once and set this up to take care of this indefinitely.</p>
